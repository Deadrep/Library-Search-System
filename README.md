#### Introduction
This repository contains the design and implementation of a C++ based library search system that allows users to search, add and remove books efficiently using appropriate data structures and algorithms. It is suitable for use in libraries with a large collection of books, and useful for anyone looking to implement a library search system or improve their understanding of data structures and algorithms.
